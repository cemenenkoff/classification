# Machine Learning Classification
### author: Nicholas Cemenenkoff
Look to `classification.ipynb` for a full, general tutorial on machine learning classification. The models explore classify numbers from the [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a large database of handwritten digits that are commonly used for training various image processing systems.

This database has been used so often it is sometimes called the "hello world" of machine learning classification. I hope you enjoy the tutorial, and if you have any feedback, please feel free to send me an email or Teams message!
